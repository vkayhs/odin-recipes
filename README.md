# odin-recipes

This is the first project in the Odin Project Foundation Course.

This project is to get a good grasp on HTML - it won't look pretty but it will be written in the correct syntax.

At the end of this project, I will have a better idea of what good HTML markup looks like, as well as how to structure my pages.
