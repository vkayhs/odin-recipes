    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ½ pounds beef tenderloin</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons butter, softened, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>2 ounces liver paté</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
      <li>large egg yolk, beaten</li>
      <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons red wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1: </strong>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2: </strong>Place beef tenderloin in a baking dish. Spread
        2 tablespoons softened butter over beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3: </strong>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 10 to
        15 minutes. Remove beef from the pan and reserve pan juices; allow beef
        to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4: </strong>Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5: </strong>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over
        medium heat. Sauté onion and mushrooms in butter for 5 minutes. Remove
        from heat and let cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong>Mix paté and remaining 2 tablespoons softened
        butter together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Spread paté
        mixture over beef. Top with onion and mushroom mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 7:</strong>Mix paté and remaining 2 tablespoons softened
        butter together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Spread paté
        mixture over beef. Top with onion and mushroom mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 8: </strong>Fold up and seal all the edges, making sure the
        seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9x13-inch baking dish, cut a
        few slits in the top of dough, and brush with egg yolk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 9: </strong>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.
        Reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and continue baking until
        pastry is a rich, golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read between 122 to 130
        degrees F (50 to 54 degrees C) for medium rare. Set aside to rest.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 10: </strong>Meanwhile, place reserved pan juices in a
        small saucepan over high heat. Stir in beef broth and red wine; boil
        until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Strain and serve with beef.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Step 11: </strong>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
