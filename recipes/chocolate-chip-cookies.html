    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that features chocolate chips or
      chocolate morsels as its distinguishing ingredient. Chocolate chip cookies
      are claimed to have originated in the United States in 1938, when Ruth
      Graves Wakefield chopped up a Nestl√© semi-sweet chocolate bar and added
      the chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe; however, historical recipes for
      grated or chopped chocolate cookies exist prior to 1938 by various other
      authors.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Butter: </strong>This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe
        starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars.
        The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs: </strong>Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent,
        which means they help hold the dough together.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vanilla: </strong>Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of
        the chocolate chip cookies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baking Soda: </strong>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which
        means it helps the cookies rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Water: </strong>A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes,
        working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Salt: </strong>A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other
        ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flour: </strong>All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which
        adds structure to the cookie dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chocolate Chips: </strong>Of course, you'll need semisweet
        chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Nuts (optional): </strong>Walnuts are optional, but they add
        nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Beat the butter and sugars, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.</li>
      <li>Dissolve the baking soda in hot water and add to the mixture.</li>
      <li>Stir in the flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts.</li>
      <li>Drop dough onto a prepared baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Bake until the edges are golden brown.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How Long to Bake Chocolate Chip Cookies</h3>

    <p>
      In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, the chocolate chip cookies should
      be perfectly baked in about 10 minutes. The edges should be golden brown
      and the cookies should be mostly set (they'll continue to set as the
      cool).
